Chrome extension that recreates the old (pre-October 2011) "Note in Reader" experience.

Supports two modes:

1. If the current item is a Google Reader tab, and it has an item selected, that item's title/URL/body will be used as the data to note.
2. For all other web pages, the current page's URL, title (and selection, if any) will be used as the data to note.

The extension can be triggered by either clicking its icon in the Chrome toolbar or by using the Shift-Command/Control-S keyboard shortcut.

Available in the Chrome Web Store at [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ilnbkghleppkefmlddmkgmlcfgomgnbj](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ilnbkghleppkefmlddmkgmlcfgomgnbj).
